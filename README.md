# Legal Lens Backend

This repository contains the backend implementation for the Legal Lens project.

Legal Lens is a backend system built using FastAPI that answers legal questions using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach powered by a Groq-based LLM.

The backend handles document loading, semantic search, and legal question answering.
